   Explanation for issues of type "AndroidGradlePluginVersion":
   This detector looks for usage of the Android Gradle Plugin where the
   version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older
   versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick
   with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more
   recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

D:\App Projects\src\flutter\.pub-cache\hosted\pub.dartlang.org\geolocator_android-3.2.1\android\src\main\java\com\baseflow\geolocator\location\FusedLocationClient.java:69: Warning: Potentially insecure random numbers on Android 4.3 and older. Read https://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/08/some-securerandom-thoughts.html for more info. [TrulyRandom]
    SecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "TrulyRandom":
   Key generation, signing, encryption, and random number generation may not
   receive cryptographically strong values due to improper initialization of
   the underlying PRNG on Android 4.3 and below.

   If your application relies on cryptographically secure random number
   generation you should apply the workaround described in
   https://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/08/some-securerandom-thoughts.
   html .

   This lint rule is mostly informational; it does not accurately detect
   whether cryptographically secure RNG is required, or whether the workaround
   has already been applied. After reading the blog entry and updating your
   code if necessary, you can disable this lint issue.
